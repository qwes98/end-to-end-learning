## Prerequisite for learning
* In model.py, they load a csv file by using `csv.DictReader`method. So we must add initial row in our `driving_log.csv`: [center, left, right, steering, throttle, reverse, speed]
* We have to locate `driving_log.csv` in our path denoted on model.py. The image folder just locate their initial location (this path is denoted on driving_log.csv file)

## Driving
* `python drive.py model.json` (How_to~: python drive.py model.h5)

## Learing
* `python model.py`
* After learning, `model.json` and `model.h5` will be made
